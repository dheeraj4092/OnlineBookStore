              VisionWall was founded in 2024 by four passionate and creative teens: Atiksh, Prateesh, Ishaan, and Shlok. We came together with one goal: to bring bold ideas to life through stunning posters, creative books, and products that inspire young minds like ours.

            <p className="mb-6">
              From brainstorming in our notebooks to building a real business, we're proof that age doesn't limit ambition. At VisionWall, every design has a purpose, every idea is fueled by passion, and every product reflects our visionâ€”Your Vision, Your Wall.
